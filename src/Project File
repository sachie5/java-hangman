Potential Classes0
A class responsible for storing your words with a method to randomly select a word.
A class responsible for displaying the results of the guess.
A class responsible for interacting with the player e.g. capture input, print messages.
A class responsible for connecting these classes together and running the game.


Rules
We want your program to have this core functionality:
The program randomly selects a word.
The program displays the word using the underscore character "_".
With the word "ELEPHANT" the game would display "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _".
A underscore for each letter separated with a space.
The player is prompted to enter a letter as a guess. The program needs to capture their guess.
If the letter is in the word the program should recognize this.
If the letter is not in the word the player loses a life.
The program should store the guesses.
After a guess the program should print out the following:
The word with blanks / correct guesses re-displayed e.g E _ E _ _ _ _ _
The letters guessed so far e.g Letters guessed: E G
The amount of lives left e.g Lives: 8
The game continues with the player guessing more letters until the player correctly guesses the word or they

Notes
Here are some general points to consider:
Letter casing? Is "a" the same as "A"?
What happens if the player guesses a letter they have already guessed?
What happens if the player guesses a word instead of a letter?
What happens if the player guesses a number instead of a letter?
How many times can you play the game?
Number of lives is up to you depending on the level you want to play at
